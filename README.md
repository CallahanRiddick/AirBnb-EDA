In this exploratory data analysis, we will be looking at a Airbnb dataset from Kaggle with about 260,000 entries and 55 variables in an attempt to determine hidden trends in pricing and location that could then be leveraged into optimizing a travel plan to minimize cost. To achieve this the focus of this EDA will be on the variables price, city, longitude, latitude, and property type. Using these variables we will summarize and visualize the data through interactive heat maps and bar graphs in order to determine key relationships between price, location, and property type allowing for cost effective travel planning.
